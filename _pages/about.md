My name is Toni, but as nick haxor I like to use **Sh0x**. I'm 22 years old, I have a computer science degree, master's degree in cybersecurity and I'm currently working as a **pentester**. This blog is intended for the creation of content on cybersecurity but especially that content that there is little information on the internet. Nowadays there are a lot of blogs about web vulnerabilities, Hack The Box machine resolution, etc. I want to give a 180ยบ turn offering quality, unique and updated content.

I am a novice with all the letters, but the idea of this blog is also to see that progression and somehow it is captured somewhere.
